		Examples ::::

			Continuous Delivery :
			
			Banking Systems 
			Finace / INS 
			
			Production Deployment Window ::: 4hrs and 6hrs. Non-Business hours 
			Manual Approvals from all the stake holders 
			
			
			Continuous Deployment : 
			
			Amazon.com 
			Netflix 
			Facebook 
			
		DevOps - Strategy / Process 
		
		
			Speed up the product development to deployment!

			DevOps Team :::
			
			What is DevOps ?
			
				DevOps is a Software Development strategy which promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Teams to achieve Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment in more automated fashion.

			What are the various Stages of DevOps ?
			
				Continuous Development ::		===> 
					IDE, Co
					Tradition process :: Code, Build (Compile & Create artifacts) perform Unittesting, promote the code to testing environments manually)					
					Thru DevOps Automation :: CI/CD -- > Build (Compile & Create artifacts) perform Unittesting, promote the code to testing environments automatically)
				Continuous Integration
					promote the code to testing environments automatically
				Continuous Testing
					Continuous Testing --> Test automation tools -- > Test data, test scenarios, test cases 
					
				Continuous Delivery		--> Will enforce manual approval from all stake holders before production release 
				
				Continuous Deployment	--> No Manual approvals need for production release
				
				Continuous Monitoring  --> Monitoring Prod Environment


				Feedback.
				
				Continuous IMPROVEMENT

			DevOps ::
			
				People 
				Strategy / Process 
				Tools 
				
			DevOps - Associates , Engg., Lead , Architects , Consultants 
			
			
			What are the various DevOps Tools ?
			
				Continuous Development ::		
					===> IDE - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Intellij, Vstudio
							GIT -- SCM 
							
					Application Build ==> Is a process of compiling the source code & Creating Artifacts (binaries - 0 & 1s)
										*.war *.jar *.exec *.dll files
					
					Tradition process :: Code, Build (Compile & Create artifacts) perform Unittesting, promote the code to testing environments manually)	
					
					Thru DevOps Automation :: CI/CD -- > Build (Compile & Create artifacts) perform Unittesting, promote the code to testing environments automatically)
					
				Continuous Integration
					===> Jenkins, Maven, ant, Gradle  
					
					promote the code to testing environments automatically
				Continuous Testing
					===> Jenkins, Testing Tools - Junit, TestNG, Selenium
					Continuous Testing --> Test automation tools -- > Test data, test scenarios, test cases 
					
				Continuous Delivery		--> Will enforce manual approval from all stake holders before production release 
					===> Jenkins, Tomcat/Nginx, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes 
				
				Continuous Deployment	--> No Manual approvals need for production release
					===> Jenkins, Tomcat/Nginx, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes
				
				Continuous Monitoring  --> Monitoring Prod Environment
					===> Jenkins, Promethes/Grafana/Splunk/Nagios/AppDynamics
					
					Infra-Structure
						:	Promethes/Grafana/Splunk/Nagios/					
					Applications 
						:	AppDynamics


				Continuous IMPROVEMENT 
				
				
				Plan ==> ALM Tools --> Application Lifecycle Management Tools - Jira, Az Boards
				
				
				Jenkins ==> Build Orchestration Tool
				bamboo
				gitlab-ci
				az-pipeline
				aws-codepipeline
